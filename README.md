The text only adventure.

Although all of the source code is free to use, it is not free to play at the moment and I have not provided all of the installation details at the moment to make it more difficult to install.  Feel free to use the source code any way you feel fit, but you are not free to use the titles, stories, or characters from the game code to your own projects without explicit written permission omegachysis@outlook.com is the sent-to address for this permission.  Don't worry, I don't bite.  Thank you for your cooperation in this matter and I hope that you may use the code to aid in your learning of Python text-only adventure games!
